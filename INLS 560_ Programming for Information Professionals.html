						<h2 class="page-heading"><a name="approach"></a><span>COURSE DESIGN AND APPROACH</span></h2>
						
						<p>Computer programming is about problem solving.  It is about breaking down a problem into smaller pieces, developing solutions for those sub-problems, and connecting them together to address the overall challenge.  As Steve Jobs, the visionary founder of Apple Computer said, "Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer... because it teaches you to think."</p>

<p>This class will provide an introduction to programming with a focus on the Python programming language.  The course will teach you how to use Python, its syntax, and its features.  However, the course will present material that is much more fundamental.  You will learn a bit about how computers work.  You will learn about data representations and structures. You will learn about flow control concepts including conditionals and iteration.  You will learn design techniques, best practices, and debugging methods.</p>

<p>However, this course is not just about concepts.  Throughout the semester, you'll be given opportunities for hands-on practice.  This includes both in-class exercises and homework assignments.  This follows a "learning by doing" philosophy which motivates much of this course's design.  Given this design, you'll find that many class sessions include classroom exercises on your own laptop.  You'll also find that the course schedule includes a large number of assignments, each designed to reinforce different course topics.

</p><p><b>BEWARE: This class will require you to invest a significant amount of time to succeed.</b>  As a student in this course, you will be asked to complete readings in our text book, perform in-class exercises, and code up solutions to homework assignments.  There will also be a final exam.  Students who invest the required time in these activities will succeed.  However, do not wait until the last minute to complete your assignments.  If you do, you may find that you simply don't have enough time to do the required work.

</p>

						<p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="page-heading"><a name="books"></a><span>BOOKS AND READINGS</span></h2>
						
						<p>The organization for this course will adhere closely to the required textbook "<u>Starting out with Python</u>", Fourth Edition, by Tony Gaddis (published by Pearson).  This book is sometimes referenced as SOWP elsewhere on this website.  Copies of the textbook should be available in the Student Bookstore.  The book is also available from online retailers in two versions (both with the same content):</p>
						<ul>
						<li> Bound paperback (more expensive):
						<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Python-Tony-Gaddis/dp/0134444329">Amazon</a>;
						<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/starting-out-with-python-tony-gaddis/1126352576">Barnes and Noble</a>
						</li><li> Loose leaf paperback (slightly less expensive):
						<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Python-Student-Value/dp/0134444469">Amazon</a>
						</li></ul><br>

<p>Previous versions of the book (e.g., the 3rd edition) have VERY similar content.  Used copies of the 3rd edition could be used instead of the new 4th edition if you can find an old copy.   However, chapters, section numbers, and page numbers may differ.  If you decide to use an edition other than the 4th edition, you should know that you are also taking on the added responsibility to  recognizing these differences when completing the assigned readings and exercises.</p>

						<p>I recognize that this book requires an investment on your part.
						This particular book has been selected because
						of the positive reviews from past
						INLS 560 students here at UNC.  
						Those students strongly recommended this book, and it will
						be used extensively
						throughout the semester.</p>

						<p>In addition to the required textbook, there many other resources available to students who are interested in learning more.  Many of these resources are available online.  Good places to look for more about programming and Python include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Google (or Bing)</span>.  The search engines you use every day are perhaps the best place to go to find examples, code snippets, documentation, and more.  I myself use Google every day that I program to look things up.  The web is the first place I go for help.  You'll see this in class as we go through exercises together.
							</li><li>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Think Python</span>" by Allen Downey.  Available <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/">online</a> and in print from O'Reilly.
							</li><li>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Learn Python</span>", an <a href="http://www.learnpython.org/">online interactive tutorial</a>.
							</li><li>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Learn Python the Hard Way</span>" by Zed Shaw.  Available online and in print from Addison-Wesley.  Available <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">online</a> and in print from Addison-Wesley.

						<p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="page-heading"><a name="policies"></a><span>CLASS POLICIES</span></h2>
						
						<h3 class="related-heading">Participation</h3>
						<p>Class participation is a key element of this course.  All students are expected to come to class prepared to be engaged, to participate in all class exercises, and to contribute to group discussions.  In addition:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Be on time for class.
							</li><li>If you know in advance that you will be miss a class, arrive late to class, or leave early from class, please let me know ahead of time.
							</li><li>If you miss class unexpectedly, please let me know why you were absent before the next class meeting.
							</li><li>Repeated absences or late arrivals will negatively impact your class participation grade.
							</li><li>If you don't understand something from class, <b>ask questions!</b> You can ask in class, you can stop by my office during office hours, or you can ask on the class discussion forum (see <a href="https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2018_spring/inls560_001/other.html#resources">here</a> for more information).
							</li><li>"Quality is better than quantity."  Class participation is part of your grade for this course.  However, there are many ways to participate.
						</li></ul>
						<p></p>
						<h3 class="related-heading">Assignments</h3>
						<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assignments are due</span> by the
						start of class on the day they
						are due unless otherwise
						specified.  For assignments
						that are due on days when class
						is not scheduled, they must be
						submitted by the normal class
						starting time (even though
						class is not meeting) unless
						otherwise specified.</b></p><b>
						
						<p><b><span style="text-decoration:
					underline;">Assignments are to be
				submitted</span> using Sakai unless instructed
			otherwise.  Submission instructions will be included
			with each assignment description.</b></p><b>

						<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Late assignments</span> will be
						penalized 10% for each day late,
						up to a maximum of three days.
						A "day" here refers to a 24
						hour period, or fraction
						thereof, after the due date.
						For example, a late assignment
						turned in 25 hours late will be
						penalized as two days late.
						No assignments will be accepted if more than 72 hours (3 days) late.</p>
						
						<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Start early</span> and ask questions.
						Many assignments may turn out to be more time consuming than expected.  It
						is strongly suggested that you start working on assignments as soon as they
						are assigned.  In this way, you'll have time to ask questions and complete
						your assignment before the due date.</p>

						<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exceptions due to
						special circumstances</span>
					will be considered on a case-by-case
					basis.  When deemed appropriate,
					limited extensions may be granted.
					However, be sure to inform the
					instructor <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AS SOON AS POSSIBLE</span> should
					you require a special accommodation.  If
					a problem is known about in advance,
					then the instructor should be told
					before it occurs.  Exceptions are much less likely to be
					provided if requests for accommodation are not made in a
					timely fashion.</p>
					
					<h3 class="related-heading">Office Hours</h3>
						<p>Those with questions about course material,
						having trouble with assignments, or seeking any other
						kind of assistance related to class are encouraged to
						meet with the instructor during office hours.  Regularly
						scheduled hours are posted to the "Course Information"
						section on <a href="https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2018_spring/inls560_001/index.html">the home page
							for this class website</a>.</p>

						<p>Meetings by appointment can
						be made when scheduling
						problems prevent students from
						seeking help during regularly scheduled office hours.
						
					</p><h3 class="related-heading">Honor Code</h3>
						<p>All assignments and exams are expected to be completed individually. Students are
						expected to adhere to the <a href="https://studentconduct.unc.edu/honor-system">UNC Honor Code</a>.

						</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="page-heading"><a name="grading"></a><span>GRADING</span></h2>
						
						<p>Your grade for this course will be determined by a combination of three
						distinct elements: programming assignments, exams, and class participation.
						The approximate contributions of these three elements to your grade are as
						follows:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>60% - Assignments
							</li><li>25% - Exams
							</li><li>15% - Class Participation
						</li></ul>
						<br> <p>Please note that class
						participation grades will be
						based on general participation
						during class
						discussions/activities,
						participation in the online
						discussion forum, and class
						attendance.</p>

						<p>Grades will follow the
						standard UNC grading system as
						outlined by the <a href="http://registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/grades/explanation-of-grading-system/">Office
					of the University Registrar</a>.  The
				grading scale will be curved, with the highest
				grades reserved (as outlined by the Registrar)
				for those with "the highest level of attainment
				that can be expected."</p>
